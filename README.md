# AirBnB Data Analysis with Tableau

This repository contains the Tableau project files and a brief overview of the analysis conducted on AirBnB data. The project aims to explore pricing patterns, listing distributions, and revenue trends based on various factors.

## Project Overview

The Tableau dashboard provides insights into the following aspects of the AirBnB dataset:
Avg Price per Bedroom: Visualizes the average price of listings based on the number of bedrooms. This helps understand how price scales with accommodation size.
Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: Shows the distribution of listings across different bedroom counts, indicating the most common types of accommodations available.
Price per Zipcode (Map): Displays the average price of listings geographically, allowing for the identification of higher and lower-priced areas.
Price by Zipcode (Bar Chart): Presents a sorted bar chart of average prices per zipcode, offering a more detailed comparison of pricing across different locations.
Revenue for Year:** Tracks the estimated revenue over the course of the year, providing insights into seasonal trends and overall earning potential.

## Tableau Files

The repository includes the following Tableau files:

This file contains the Tableau dashboard, worksheets, and connections to the data source.

## Data Source

While the actual data file is not included in this repository for privacy and size considerations, the analysis was likely performed on a dataset containing information about AirBnB listings, including:

 Price
  Number of bedrooms
 Zipcode/Neighborhood
  Listing ID (for revenue calculation)
 Date of booking/availability (for revenue calculation) etc

## Key Findings (Based on the Visualizations)

 The average price per listing generally increases with the number of bedrooms.
 Listings with 1 or 2 bedrooms are the most common.
 There is significant variation in average prices across different zipcodes.
  The estimated revenue appears to show a trend over the year, potentially indicating seasonality. (Further interaction with the live dashboard would reveal more specific trends).

## Further Analysis

This project provides a foundational analysis of the AirBnB data. Further exploration could involve:

 Analyzing the impact of other factors like property type, amenities, and host information on pricing and revenue.
 Conducting sentiment analysis on reviews.
 Building predictive models for occupancy rates or pricing.
